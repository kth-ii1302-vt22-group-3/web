# Web Structure Description

The structure used in this Web repository is based on MVP archtectural pattern. The reason for this choise of architectural patterns as basis for web component with in this project is that is widely spread. It can be precived common knowledge amoung software devlopers, making picking up this project and getting to work fast and easy. This is represented by the file structure in the reposity, intended to make navigation and delimitation clear and understandable. The dircotories named model-view-presenter are delimeited to only include classes that represent just those part of the archtectural pattern. Other classes or files are to be saved in outside the pattern or in separately layered direcotries.    

In addition to the directories named after model-view-presenter there is a forth directory named api. This directory contain classes and files for establishing API connectivety and configuring API:s, amoung other API adjacent files. The directory is restricted to these type of files only.
